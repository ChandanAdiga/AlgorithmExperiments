There are N bulbs, numbered from 1 to N, arranged in a row. The
first bulb is plugged to power socket and each successive bulb is
connected to the previous one (the second bulb to the first, the
third bulb to second, etc)

Assume all bulbs are turned off. At a moment K (for K from 0 to N-1),
we turn on the A[K]th bulb. A bulb shines if it is on and all the
previous bulbs are turned on too.

Write a function such that given a array A of N different integers from
1 to N, returns the number of moments for which every turned on bulb
shines.

Given A = [2,1,3,5,4] the function should return 3.
